# Energy-Consumption-Prediction---Machine-Learning


The objective of this project was to use the supervised Machine Learning Approach to build a model that can predict with some level of precision the volume of energy that would be used based on a number of attributes.

**Steps taken **
Data Exploration
Data Cleaning
Exploratory Analysis
Data Preprocessing
Building the Model with Random Forest Tree (Linear Regression)
Testing the Model.

The built model had a predictive accuracy of 85%, which means predictions would be correct 8.5 out of 10 times.

**Final Comment:** While 85% is a great score considering the dynamic nature and technological changes experienced in the energy sector, however, the score can be bettered with more data or more trained attributes
